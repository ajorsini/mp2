Writes:
  1. When a replica is down, the coordinator writes to other replicas and keep a local copy until the down replica comes back up.
  2. When all replicas are down, the coordinator keeps a copy for some hours (timeout) expecting the replicas to come back up
  3. When a replica receives a write request,
  3.1. Log it in a log file in disk
  3.2. Make changes in the appropriate memtables
  3.2.1. In-Memory representation of key-value pairs
  3.2.2. Cache that can be searched by key
  3.2.3. write back, as opposed to write through
  3.3. When memtable is old or full, flush to disk
  3.3.1. SSTable, list of key-value pairs sorted by key
  3.3.2. index file, an SSTable of key-position in data SSTable
  3.3.3. bloom filter
  4. Periodically merge SSTables

Deletes:
  1. add a tomstone to the log
  2. when compacting, delete the item

Read:
  1. send read(key) to multiple replicas
  2. when Q replicas return a value, the coordinator returns the latest-timestamped one
  3. in the background the coordination may trigger key consistency to latest-timestamped value
